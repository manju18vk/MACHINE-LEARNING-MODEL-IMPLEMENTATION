TASK - 1: Predictive Modeling with scikit-learn
Objective:
To implement a predictive classification model that classifies the iris flowers dataset using a Random Forest Classifier. The goal is to demonstrate the steps of data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

------
Key Activities:
Data exploration and visualization
Data preprocessing (scaling and splitting)
Model training using Random Forest Classifier
Model evaluation using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Visualization of results, including confusion matrix and feature importance
Technologies Used:
Python Programming Language
Libraries:
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
Scope:
This project uses the Iris dataset from scikit-learn, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The objective is to build a predictive model that can classify the species of iris flowers based on these features.

Advantages:
Demonstrates the process of training and evaluating a classification model.
Easy-to-understand Iris dataset with clear relationships among features.
Use of visualization tools to present data insights and model performance.
Disadvantages:
The Iris dataset is relatively simple and may not be suitable for real-world complex classification problems.
Overfitting might occur with more complex models due to the small size of the dataset.
Key Insights:
Random Forest model provides high accuracy with relatively simple hyperparameters.
The most important features in determining the flower species were the petal length and petal width.
Future Improvements:
Experiment with more advanced models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
Tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for better performance.
Implement cross-validation for better model evaluation.
Code Explanation:
The code below demonstrates how to build and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers.

Libraries: Necessary libraries are imported, including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data handling and visualization, as well as scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
Dataset: The Iris dataset is loaded using scikit-learn, and it is split into features (X) and target labels (y).
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, followed by feature scaling using StandardScaler to standardize the features.
Model: A RandomForestClassifier is initialized and trained on the training data.
Evaluation: The modelâ€™s accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are computed to evaluate its performance.
Visualization: The confusion matrix and feature importance are visualized for better understanding of the model's predictions and the importance of each feature.
